# parser-combinator-boilerplate
A parser combinator boilerplate code in Python to be copy-pasted everywhere.

For some reason my highschool CS class (IB CS) is obsessed with parsers. Instead of following instructions and writing a new parser for every single boring assignment (you know, like a peasant), iMmA cOpY tHiS cOdE eVeRyWhErE.

`parser.py` is a the long version and demonstrates how stuff works, while `parser_min.py` is the shortened version with equivalent functionalities.
